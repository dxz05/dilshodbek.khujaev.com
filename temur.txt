EXPERIENCE
----------

Quantitative Risk Analyst & ML Engineer – project based contract
Mar. 2025 – present
ResearchWorks LTD. Part-time Project (Python, LightGBM, SQLite, Statistical Analysis)
Tashkent, Uzbekistan
• Developed behavioral risk prediction system for proprietary day traders using machine learning to predict negative PnL with 70%+ precision and Sharpe ratio over than 0.5.
• Engineered 20+ behavioral features from trading data (revenge trading, loss aversion, position sizing) with proper temporal validation to prevent data leakage.
• Built end-to-end pipeline: PropreReports API ingestion → SQLite database → feature engineering → LightGBM model → automated email alerts with calibrated confidence scores.
• Implemented time-series cross-validation and backtesting framework with transaction cost modeling, achieving lower Expected Calibration Error for risk predictions.

Optimization Engineer, Operations Research & Development
Sep. 2022 – Feb. 2025
Optifly - Airline Scheduling Software, (Java, Python)
Dublin, Ireland (Remote)
• Recommendation letter from Optifly Head of Research: View letter
• Applied advanced heuristic and metaheuristic techniques (e.g. Genetic Algorithms, TreeSearch Heuristics) to streamline airline scheduling workflows, reducing performance bottlenecks and elevating profit and speed performance at least by 10% and 25% respectively.
• Engineered high-priority constraint programming features within demanding client deadlines, fortifying both system reliability and operational throughput in combination of Java and Python languages.
• Led in-depth performance analyses to pinpoint and resolve bottlenecks, software defects, and suboptimal solution paths, driving improvements in runtime efficiency and overall solution quality.
• Adopted and refined specialized data structures and advanced algorithms, significantly amplifying the scheduling engine's scalability for intricate constraints.
• Rapidly learned airline industry domain intricacies, translating client expectations into effective, data-driven functionalities that exceeded operational targets.
• Collaborated with stakeholders to clarify loosely defined scheduling preferences, translating them into clear data parameters and integrating them into the core algorithm — ensuring results aligned with customer goals.
• Explored and introduced advanced mathematical techniques (e.g., refined constraints, multi-objective optimization) to significantly boost performance and accuracy, while preserving clean, maintainable code.
• Adhered to robust coding standards (e.g., version control, thorough testing, code reviews) that ensured new features were smoothly integrated and upheld system stability.
