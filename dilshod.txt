EDUCATION
---------
Carnegie Mellon University Qatar | Education City, Qatar
August 2024 – May 2028
Bachelor of Computer Science
• QCPC 2024 Winner: Claimed first place in the Qatar Collegiate Programming Contest 2024.
• ACPC 2024 Bronze medalist: Achieved a bronze medal in the Arab & African Collegiate Programming Championship.

EXPERIENCE
----------

Competitive Programming
• 6+ years of experience on Codeforces (max rating 2258, top 1% on platform), CodeChef, AtCoder, and LeetCode, solving 3000+ problems that span dynamic programming, graph algorithms, network flow, and advanced data structures. Skilled at optimizing solutions for both time and space complexity.
• Co-authored 5 CodeChef contests and created 30+ interview-style problems at WeCreateProblems (WeCP), emphasizing time/space optimization, algorithmic design, and best practices for high-level technical interviews.

National Olympiads in Informatics
Tashkent, Uzbekistan

Coach & Team Leader
January 2024 – August 2024
• Mentored and trained top-performing students in advanced algorithms and data structures, leading to multiple national achievements and an IOI qualification.
• In collaboration with the Ministry of Digital Technologies, organized an educational camp for girls interested in IT, fostering diversity and inclusion in the field.
• Served as the Coach and Team Leader for Uzbekistan in the European Girls' Olympiad in Informatics (EGOI 2024), where a student achieved a bronze medal.

Scientific Committee
September 2023 – August 2024
• Created more than 40 IOI-styled competitive programming problems that include advanced algorithms and data structures, including graph theory, dynamic programming, and more.
  ◦ Each problem consisted of 3–9 smaller subproblems, each requiring additional preparation and a feedback system, allowing participants to earn partial credit. These problems were used in regional olympiads that served as selection rounds for international olympiads (IOI, EGOI, IZhO, etc.).
• Developed more than 25 ICPC-styled problems for various regional olympiads for high school students, where the hardest problems played a crucial role in determining the winners.
